Overview
--------
The purpose of this analysis was to use different machine learning techniques to train and evaluate models related to credit risk and its inherently unbalanced classification problem.

Based on the results from the 6 different machine learning techniques, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier gave us the best results and would be my recommendation as the model to use. This conclusion was reached by comparing the accuracy, precision, and recall - precision was the same for all 6 models, however, accuracy an recall were 0.93 and 0.94, respectively, which greatly outperformed the other models.
